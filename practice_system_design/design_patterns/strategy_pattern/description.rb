# Certainly! The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. Let's implement a simple example of the Strategy Pattern in Ruby.

# In this example, we'll create a billing system that calculates the total amount for a customer's purchase using different discount strategies.

# In this example:

# DiscountStrategy is the strategy interface that defines the method apply_discount.
# NoDiscountStrategy, TenPercentDiscountStrategy, and TwentyPercentDiscountStrategy are concrete strategies that implement specific discount algorithms.
# BillingContext is the context that takes a discount strategy and uses it to calculate the total amount for a purchase.
# The client code demonstrates how to use different discount strategies by creating instances of the concrete strategy classes and passing them to the BillingContext. The BillingContext then applies the selected strategy to calculate the total amount after the discount.

# This example illustrates how the Strategy Pattern allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm dynamically at runtime while keeping the strategies interchangeable.
