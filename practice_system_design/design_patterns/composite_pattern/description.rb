# The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. Here's an example of the Composite Pattern in Ruby:

# In this example:

# Component is the component interface that declares the common interface for all concrete classes.
# Leaf is a leaf node that represents individual objects in the composition.
# Composite is a composite node that can have children, either leaves or other composites.
# The client code demonstrates how to create a composite structure, add leaves and composites to it, and invoke the operation method on the entire structure. The key idea is that both leaves and composites can be treated uniformly through the common Component interface.

# When running this example, you'll see that the Composite object can contain both leaves and other composites, and the operation method can be invoked recursively to display the entire structure.
