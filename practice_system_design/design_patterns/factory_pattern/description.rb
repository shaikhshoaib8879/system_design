# Certainly! The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Here's an example of the Factory Pattern in Ruby:
# In this example:

# Animal is the product interface, defining the method speak.
# Dog and Cat are concrete products that implement the Animal interface.
# AnimalFactory is the factory interface with a method create_animal.
# DogFactory and CatFactory are concrete factories that create instances of Dog and Cat, respectively.
# The client code demonstrates how to use the factories to create different types of animals. By doing this, the client code is decoupled from the specific classes of objects it creates, allowing for easy extension and flexibility.

# This example showcases the Factory Pattern's ability to encapsulate object creation, making it possible to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
