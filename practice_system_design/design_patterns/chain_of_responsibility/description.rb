# Certainly! The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that passes requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. Here's an example of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern in Ruby:

# Handler is the handler interface that defines the method handle_request.
# ConcreteHandlerA, ConcreteHandlerB, and ConcreteHandlerC are concrete handlers that implement the handle_request method and decide whether to handle the request or pass it to the next handler.
# The client code demonstrates how to set up a chain of responsibility and send requests through the chain. Each handler in the chain decides whether it can handle the request or should pass it to the next handler.

# This pattern promotes the decoupling of senders and receivers of requests, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will ultimately process the request.
